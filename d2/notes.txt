DATA TYPES
	1. String:
		-> all the text u type, is also the default datatype.
		-> use [place] to print the alphabet at a particular place in the text(numbering starts as 0,1,...)
		-> a set of numbers kept inside the quotes behave as a string.

	2. Integer:
		-> simple numbers are taken as numbers itself by the comp.
		-> large nos. like 123,456,789 can be written as 123_456_789 in python.

	3. Float:
		-> numbers with a point or decimal point.

	4. Boolean:
		-> has only two values 'True' or 'False'.

Note*: to check the type of data you have entered use type(your input) and put it in print fuxn.


Changing data type:
	1. put your data into str(), int() or float() function to change or describe its type. 

Operations:
	1. Addition: no.1 + no.2
	2. Subtraction: no.1 - no.2
	3. Multiplication: no.1 * no.2
	4. Division: no.1 / no.2 (always gives floating point number)	
	5. Exponent: first no. ** second no. (raises the power)

		-> operations are usually performed as ()off> **> *> /> +> and -, but * & / as well as + & - are given 
		   equal prio. so the operations are executed from left to right.
		-> if we convert a floating pn. to integer all the places after the decimal are vanished.
		-> a fuxn round() is used to round off the no. and ", number" is used to specify the precision or uptil
		   how many decimal places runding to be done.

	6. Floor division:
		-> uses 2 forward slashes '//' and converts the quotient directly into an integer(no. is not rounded off).

	7. +=, -=, *= and /= are used to add, subtract, multiply or divide the upcoming value to the previous value of vari.

	8. f-strings:
		-> helps in concatenating diff. datatypes at once without changing or specifying its type.
