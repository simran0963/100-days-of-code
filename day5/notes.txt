LOOPS
  1. Loops allow us to execute the same line of code multiple times.
  2. they are written as for 'what you call the single element in the list' in 'variable used for the list'
  3. For loops in range:
	->for run the loop in a particular range of numbers use 
	      for number in range(first num., second num., third num.)
	      first num.: from where the loop is to start, including the num. itself.
	      second num.: uptil where the loop will run, excluding the num.
	      third num.: the step size of the loop or to jump on the nth num., by default it is set to 1 so all the nums. are printed.
