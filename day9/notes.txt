Dictionaries in python:
  1. allow us to group together and tag related piece of information.
    every dictionary has two parts to it:
      -> Key: the word itself
      -> Value: definition of the word 
  2. items within the dictionary are kept within the {} and separated with a ','.
  3. if the key is a string then it is given under a set if "key" and it's definition is kept within the "definition" too,correct datatypes 
     should be used

#Retrieving items from the dictionary
print(dictionary name["key written exactly same way as in the dictionary"]), use correct datatype.
  -> do not make a typo while provin=ding the key to the dictionary to avoid key error.

#Adding new items to the dictionary
dictionary name["key"] = "definition of key."

#Creating an empty dictionary
empty_dictionary = {}

#Wipe an entire dictionary
dictionary name = {}

#Edit an item in a dictionary
dictionary name["key"] = "New definition to the key."
print(dictionary name)

#Loop through thr dictionary
for thing in programming_dictionary :
  print(thing) would only print the keys.

to print key along with its definition:
