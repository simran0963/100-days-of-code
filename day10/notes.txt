Functions with outputs
1. The python return statement is used in a function to return the value to the caller program, which is used only within the function.
2. If the return statement contains an expression, itâ€™s evaluated first and then the value is returned, which terminates the execution of 
   the function
3. A function can have multiple return statements having mutliple types of values. When any of them is executed, the function terminates.
