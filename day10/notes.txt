Functions with outputs
   1. The python return statement is used in a function to return the value to the caller program, which is used only within the function.
   2. If the return statement contains an expression, itâ€™s evaluated first and then the value is returned, which terminates the execution of 
      the function
   3. A function can have multiple return statements having mutliple types of values. When any of them is executed, the function terminates.

Return keyword
   1. The return keyword is to exit a function and return a value.
   2. Statements after the return line will not be executed as:
         def myfunction():
            return 3+3
            print("Hello, World!")

         print(myfunction())

      For the given code, the result would be given as:
         6, which proves that the value of 3 + 3 is returned to the function but the next statement never executes.
   3. multiple return statements can be used in a function
