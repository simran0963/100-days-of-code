A. Conditional statements:used when you have some conditions for your code to execute.

NOTE*: when the conditional statements are used after our condition a ':' is used, followed by a strict indentation 
       pattern which remains unchanged for the upcoming conditions.
       
	1. if statement:
		-> when the input satisfies the given condition only then execution of code occurs or it will be ignored.

	2. else statement:
		-> when the above conditions does not hold, true only then will it come to action.

	3. elif statement:
		-> when there are more than two conditions instead of using if we use elif or elseif statement.


B.Comparison operators:
	1. greater than (>)
	2. less than (<)
	3. greater than or equal to: (>=)
	4. less than or equal to (<=)
	5. equal to (==)
	6. not equal to (!=)

NOTE*: in python '=' is used to assign the value on the rhs to the lhs variable whereas
        '==' is used to check if lhs value and rhs value are equal or not.

C. Modulo(%) sign gives us the remainder after dividing the first no. with the second one.

D. Nested if/else statements:
	-> if the condition for an if or else statement comes true then another if/else condition within it.

E. Logical operators:
	1. and operator: only if both the values are true, the answer will be true.
	2. or operator: if either of the value first or second or both are true then the entire statement is true. 
	3. not operator: it reverses the value from true to false and vice versa.

F. lower() function: reduce all the alhabets to lower case.
G. count() function: no. of times an alphabet occurs in a string.
