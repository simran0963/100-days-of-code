                                                                                         Basics of Python

	1. Print function
		-> use print() {then "" for strings} to avoid syntax error.
		-> try to avoid using "" twice in a line.
		-> to print a text on separate lines use \n (without any space) using only one fuxn.

	2. String Concatenation:
		-> takes the characters of the string to merge them into one  (without any space btwn them). 
		-> use "text" + "text" to concatenate.

	3. Space in Python matters to avoid indentation errors.

	4. Debugging:
		-> look for the errors and try to debug or fix it.
		-> to debug an error just copy the error and look for it on stack overflow.
	
	5. Input function
		-> code execution does not end after it runs but after the input is given.
		-> works like the print fuxn and the (" ") are used.  

	6. Comment: 
		->  a '#' is used before the text                            
		-> can be used to explin ouir code.
		-> is never executed and ignored by the comp.
		-> to add a line to comment select the line and press ctrl + /.
		-> to remove press ctrl + z.

	7.  Length function:
		-> use to get the no. of char. in the given string.
		-> len() is used

	8. Variables
		-> try to use a meaningful name to make ur code readable.
		-> a variable can be anything, but try to avoid fuxns as the name of vari.
		-> can be changed at any point of time.
		-> use a single unit as a variable or sep. two words using an '_'.
		-> avoid no. at the beginning of the name of variables.
