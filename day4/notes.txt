                                                                SOME MORE THINGS IN  PYTHON DAY 4
Randomisation and python lists
	1. random module was generated by python to help us create random numbers without getting into complex math to generate pseudorandom 
	   numbers.
	2. we can use a value specified in a different file by using import filename.
	3. to pick a random integer b/w any two nos. random.randint(I no., II no.) is used inclusive both nos.
	4. random.random() to generate a random float b/w 0 and 1 excluding 1, i.e., [0,1)
	5. to get a random float greater than 1 multiply the random float by any integer.
   for more detailed information on randomisation refer: askpython.com/python-modules/python-random-module-generate-random-numbers-sequences

   Python lists:
	1. they can contain multiple datatypes kept within[], items separated with a ,.
	2. the data stored within the list have an order which is same as the order they are kept in the list.
	3. the item in the list at a particular position can be printed by using a [position in the list] where the numbering starts from 0.
	   position of the list is the offset from the beginning or index and the negative index starts from the end of the list.
	4. list[position] = new name to the item: to change the items of the list.
	5. list.append: adds a new item to the end of the list.
	6. list.extend is used to add a bunch of items to the list.

     more lists refer: docs.python.org/3/tutorial/datastructures.html	

     Index Errors: when something is out of index or cannot be found.
     Nested lists or list within a list:
	1. list = [list1, list2]
