FUNCTIONS WITH INPUTS
  1.def my_function(name)
    -> #do this with name.
    -> name provided to the data is known as the Parameter.
    -> and the value assigned to this function is the Argument.
    -> the following type of arguments are positional or depends on the position so for code
      # def greet_with_name(name, location):
	print(f"Hello {name}")
	print(f"How's the weather today in {location}?")

	greet_with_name("somewhere", "jack")

      # The output will be:
        Hello somewhere
	How's the weather today in jack?
    -> so instead keyword arguments are used, where
      # the calling function would be greet_with_name(name = "jack", location = "somewhere")

  TO USE THE CLEAR FUNCTION OR IMPORT CLEAR WHILE USING VSCODE USE:
    import os
    def clear():
    	os.system('cls') to define the function

    clear() to call the function
